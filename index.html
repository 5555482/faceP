				<p>It wasn’t until about the 1980’s that we started to widespread use of face painting as a way for kids to enjoy themselves. During this time, face painting became a child’s thing, the thing that we think of it as being today. It is something that is typically seen at fairs and amusement parks and markets and festivals, places that are all-ages and where children may be enticed to get their parents to pay for fun designs to be painted on their faces. This is most common today in Europe and North America although it can be found elsewhere throughout the world as well.</p>
